This is Team Paris Azubi Africa Project repository where we will put all our projects. :book:
Each project is worked on for one month :hourglass: and is a combined effort of the team members listed below.

The works done here are of a Data Analysis in nature , worked on to sort out different business needs and wants, and hopefully better and sharpen our Data analysis skills. 

Each projects is unique from the other , therefore differnt projects rubics and evaluate in nature , BUT however its important to note that all follow a **CRISP-DM frame work** to get them done. 
Interesting findings are in every project :fire: :fire: :fire: and would invite you to take a deep dive into our curated projects.

## <span style="color:blue">**PROJECT 2 - LP2 TIME SERIES FORECASTING PROJECT**</span>
Here in LP2 , We dive into a TimeSeries forecasting analysis , where we look into sales through a given time period and be able to predict the price in a certain time in the future based on the previous dataset. 
An interesting bit in our data is that it has irregularity periods I.e; there's a time period where there is an earthquake.

A view of our data will give us more insights. 
Enjoy as you go through our LP2 work. :star:

In LP3, We have a client **Vodaphone** , That is concered on their customer churn rate, and has tasked us to do an investigation on why churning is occuring in the view of increasing customer retention.
